# Non-blocking serial port reader with timeout

This is an example of a non-blocking serial port reader. It allows the Arduino to do other things while waiting on messages to arrive at the serial port.

## Example use cases

- Changing output waveforms that drive beam steerers on the fly for iSCAT or iSIM
- Changing the LED array output on the ptychography setup
